# Predictive Model for Flu Detection Using LSTM

## Project Goal
The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that leverages synthetic time series data to determine whether patients are likely to contract the flu. The model will be constructed using **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks, a specialized type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) known for its ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on generating and utilizing a time series dataset with the following three primary features:

- **Temperature**: The average daily temperature.
- **Month**: The month of the year, capturing seasonal variations.
- **Past Flu Occurrences**: The number of flu cases reported in the previous days.

These features will be used to predict the target variable: whether a patient has the flu or not. The LSTM network will learn patterns and relationships within the sequential data to make accurate predictions, achieving a model accuracy generally above **87%**.

## Tools and Techniques

### Data Generation
- Synthetic data will be generated to simulate real-world conditions.
- The dataset will include values for temperature, month, and past flu occurrences.

### Preprocessing
- Features will be normalized and encoded to prepare them for input into the LSTM model.
- Numerical features, such as date and temperature, will be scaled, while categorical features, such as the month, will be converted into appropriate numerical representations.

### Modeling
- **LSTM Networks**: The model will use LSTM due to its effectiveness in handling time series data with long-term dependencies.
- **Libraries**: The model will be built and trained using TensorFlow, a widely-used deep learning library.

## Feature Descriptions and Their Importance

### Temperature
- **Importance**: Temperature is a critical factor in flu transmission and severity. Colder temperatures are often associated with higher flu incidence rates. Including this feature enables the model to learn how temperature fluctuations influence flu occurrence.

### Month
- **Importance**: The month feature captures seasonal variations, which are crucial for understanding flu patterns. Flu season typically peaks in colder months, and this feature helps the model recognize and account for these seasonal trends.

### Past Flu Occurrences
- **Importance**: Historical flu data provides context for current flu risks. If there have been several recent cases of the flu, the likelihood of new cases may increase. This feature helps the model detect patterns based on past occurrences, boosting predictive accuracy.

## Synopsis
By combining these features with **LSTM networks**, this project aims to develop a robust predictive model that can effectively forecast flu occurrences. Achieving a model accuracy of **87% or higher**, this model offers valuable insights into flu transmission patterns, which could be instrumental in improving public health responses and managing flu outbreaks.
